tasks
task 0. Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

task 1.RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that

n = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

This task is the same as task 0, except:

p and q are always prime numbers
There is only one number in the files
How far can you go in less than 5 seconds?
